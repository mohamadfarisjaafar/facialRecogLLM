# Image Recognition with OpenCV and LLM

This project is a simple **image recognition tool** that uses **OpenCV** for image processing and a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, for image recognition. The application allows users to upload an image, processes the image with OpenCV, and generates a description or recognition result using the LLM.

### Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload an image file from the frontend.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV processes the image (e.g., grayscale conversion, face detection).
- **LLM Integration**: The processed image features are sent to an LLM (OpenAI GPT-4) for description or recognition.
- **Result Display**: Display the result of the image recognition on the frontend.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js for the user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js for handling image uploads and communicating with OpenCV and OpenAI APIs.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for basic image processing and feature extraction (e.g., face detection).
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 API for generating image recognition descriptions.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js**: Required for the backend and frontend.
- **Vue.js**: Required for the frontend.
- **Python**: Required for OpenCV (if not using Node.js bindings).
- **OpenCV**: Installed via `opencv4nodejs` or Python bindings.
- **OpenAI API Key**: For GPT-4 integration.
